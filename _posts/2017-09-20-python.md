# Installation
I installed python and python3 using homebrew but one day my system was broken, everything was a mess and did not work anymore. 
Then I moved to pyenv which is the python versions' manager (forked from rbenv) and works as a charm.

Add this to .zshrc `PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework`, no idea why but is needed for youcompleteme.

```
brew install pyenv 
pyenv install 2.7
pyenv install 3.6
cd ~
pyenv local 3.6
```

# Virtual environments
Virtual environments allows you to configure an isolated environment for each python folder/project. 
This is good to ensure compatibility of each library version for each project.

Python has different tools to manage this, but basically pyvenv for python3 and virtualenv for python2 [+info at](http://masnun.com/2016/04/10/python-pyenv-pyvenv-virtualenv-whats-the-difference.html)

## virtualenv (python2)

```
pyenv shell 2.7
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv <PYTHON_VERSION> project_folder
cd project_folder
source bin/activate
```

## pyvenv (python3)

```
pyvenv xxx 
cd xxx
source bin/activate
```

## venv (python3)

```
python3 -m venv xxx 
cd xxx
source bin/activate
```
