# BOTKIT

**Botkit** is an opensource javascript library meant to build bots.

**Botkit studio** is an online service to facilitate the process of developing and deploying bots.

For the moment I am going to do it locally instead of using studio.

1. copy the repo containing the base code to integrate botkit with slack 
[https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack.git](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-slack.git)

2. Install js library `npm install`

3. Create a slack app at [http://api.slack.com/apps](http://api.slack.com/apps) and get a `clientId` and `clientSecret`

3. Run bot `clientId= <my client id> clientSecret= <my client secret> PORT=3000 node .` (use screen at the begining to keep it in background)

Now we have to create an end to end point between slack and bot app. 

4. To do this locally we will use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) that allow run a web server with webhooks. 
`screen ngrok http 3000`

5. Click on the "Oauth & Permissions" tab in your Slack's app setting (api.slack.com), and under Redirect URLs, add: https://my-bot-url/oauth, then click save. 

6. Click on the "Interactive components" tab in your Slack's app setting (api.slack.com), and under Request URLs, add: https://my-bot-url/slack/receive, then click save. 

7. Click on the "Event subscriptions" tab in your Slack's app setting (api.slack.com), and under Request URLs, add: https://my-bot-url/slack/receive, then click save. 
Add message.channels, message.groups, message.im, message.npim into 'subscribe to bot events' section

8. Click on the "Bot Users" tab and specify a name for your bot. This is the name that will be used by default when your application creates a new bot on a user's team.
In addition to a name, enable the option for "Always Show My Bot Online."

9. Now that your bot is configured, and your application is up and running, you can login and add your bot. Visit https://my-bot-url/login
