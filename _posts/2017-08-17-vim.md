# Plugins
## Markdown Toc Generator
### Installation
1. Plugin installation:
```
Plugin 'mzlogin/vim-markdown-toc'
```

2. Generate a toc 
:GenTocGFM

From now on each time that you save your markdown file table of content will be updated.

## YouCompleteMe (Valloric/YouCompleteMe)
I have been using this plugin in vim but for neovim I use deoplete because has better performance.
### Why?
Why this and not another? Is the most active plugin and the functionalities are very advanced. 
If you need something light try VimCompleteMe that map some keys to vim omnifunc.

## ripgrep & fzf [+info](https://elliotekj.com/2016/10/30/using-ripgrep-and-fzf-instead-of-the-silver-searcher-and-ctrlp-in-vim/)

ripgrep is a faster grep alternative written in rust.

```bash
brew install ripgrep
``` 

```
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

### Installation

1. Plugin installation:
`Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'`

2. Bash

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py 
```

# Python

Some plugins requires python. In my case I've installed 2 and 3 versions of python.
```bash
pip3/pip2 install neovim --upgrade
```

The add this to ` ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:
```
"python2: let g:python_host_prog = '/usr/local/bin/python'
let g:python3_host_prog = '/Users/carles/.pyenv/shims/python'
```
