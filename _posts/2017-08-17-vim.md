# Plugins
## Markdown Toc Generator
### Installation
1. Plugin installation:
```
Plugin 'mzlogin/vim-markdown-toc'
```

2. Generate a toc
:GenTocGFM

From now on each time that you save your markdown file table of content will be updated.

## Autocomplete
There are several plugins for autocompletion, probably the most advanced and used is youcompleteme.
I have tried this but is not a good option for python since virtual envs.
Another drawback is that needs to compile each time that some library is updated.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/5w6wac/vim_users_of_reddit_whats_your_favorite/) you can see different arguments of each option.
I have been using this plugin in vim but for neovim I use deoplete because has better performance.
Each plugin has its own configuration environment, deoplete is the toughest.
I have found an answer that shows different settings [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/5w6wac/vim_users_of_reddit_whats_your_favorite/de8exsi/)

## ripgrep & fzf [+info](https://elliotekj.com/2016/10/30/using-ripgrep-and-fzf-instead-of-the-silver-searcher-and-ctrlp-in-vim/)

ripgrep is a faster grep alternative written in rust.

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

```
Plug '/usr/local/opt/fzf'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

### Installation

1. Plugin installation:
`Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe'`

2. Bash

```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py
```

# Python

Some plugins requires python. In my case I've installed 2 and 3 versions of python.
```bash
pip3/pip2 install neovim --upgrade
```

The add this to ` ~/.config/nvim/init.vim`:
```
"python2: let g:python_host_prog = '/usr/local/bin/python'
let g:python3_host_prog = '/Users/carles/.pyenv/shims/python'
```
